<h3 class="bp-subtitle">Filter Event Categories</h3>

<div class="bp-text">
<p>Event categories can be setup to allow events to be grouped together.	These categories are configured by the calendar editors.	If any event categories have been configured, a list of categories will be displayed at the bottom of some calendar views.	By clicking on the names of these categories, the current calendar view will be filtered, so that it only displays events associated with that category.	To once again display all of the events, click on the <span class="bn-input">Display All</span> link, listed at beginning of the list of categories.</p>
