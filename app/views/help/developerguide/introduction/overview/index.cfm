<p>Although calendarInfusion is designed to provide a complete set of calendar functionality, Infusion Technology recognizes that it will not satisfy everyone's needs.	For this reason, calendarInfusion was designed around a core architecture, with the goal of providing a framework that can be easily modified by developer's within your organization.</p>

<p>In addition, with the introduction of its MX product line, Macromedia has introduced a complete suite of tools for an entire web development team, from graphic designers to software engineers.	Future versions of calendarInfusion will be even more tightly integrated with the advanced features of ColdFusion MX, such as Flash integration and Java support.	In order to more easily make the transition to this new version of ColdFusion and yet create a product that could be used by legacy versions, the calendarInfusion framework was designed to make this transition easy.</p>

<p>The calendarInfusion Developer's Guide will provide some insights into the various elements that went into the design of the calendarInfusion architecture and will attempt to give developers the tools and information they need to customize the calendarInfusion code to fit your organization's needs.</p>
