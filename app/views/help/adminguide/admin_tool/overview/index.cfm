<h3 class="bp-subtitle">Administrator Tool Overview</h3>

<div class="bp-text">
<p>The calendarInfusion Administrator Tool provides access to virtually all of the features required to manage the calendarInfusion application.	The Administrator Tool is used to create new calendars, manage the Verity search collections, manage the application cache, and many other features.	The Administrator Tool is <span style="font-weight:bold;">not</span> used to manage an individual calendar.	(Calendar administration is handled by the calendarInfusion Editor Tool.)	Except for the creation of new calendars, global holidays, global schemes, and application debugging, use of the Administrator Tool is rarely required.</p>
