* INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
****************************************************************************

**** PLEASE NOTE: calendarInfusion is currently in "beta" status.  Although
most of the functionality has been implemented, it has not yet been fully
tested.  Use at your own risk! :)

 1. Since you are reading this file, we will assume you have successfully
    downloaded and unzipped the calendarInfusion installation package to
	<unzip_root>.

 2. calendarInfusion relies on the Mach-II framework and it must be
    installed in order to use calendarInfusion.  Please visit
	http://www.mach-ii.com/ for more information.

 3. Copy the contents of this installation package to the appropriate
    locations on your server.  The critical folders in this packages are:
	
		/app      - This folder contains all of the listeners, models,
		            views, etc and is accessed via a single ColdFusion
		            mapping.
		/config   - These configuration files are read to initialize the
		            application.  They can be located anywhere, as long
		            as they can be read by the ColdFusion server.
		/db       - Contains the database creation scripts.  These can be
		            located anywhere.
		/public   - This is the webroot of the application, it should be
		            located within your webroot (e.g. C:\InetPub\wwwroot)

	The remaining folders are for development and testing purposes (or, at
	least, are not being used at this time).
 
 4. Create a ColdFusion mapping:
    a. Login to the ColdFusion Administrator
    b. Click on the 'Mappings' link
    c. Enter the necessary information to create a new mapping:
         Logical Path: /calendar
         Directory Path: Absolute path to /app directory (from Step 3)

 5. Install the calendarInfusion databases
    a. Microsoft Access
       (1) Copy the calendarInfusion.mdb files from <unzip_root>\db to your
	       preferred database storage location.
    b. Microsoft SQL Server
       (1) Create a new database for calendarInfusion
       (2) Execute <unzip_root>\db\calendarinfusion_mssql.sql
	c. MySQL
       (1) Create a new database for calendarInfusion
       (2) Execute <unzip_root>\db\calendarinfusion_mysql.sql
	d. PostgreSQL
       (1) Create a new database for calendarInfusion
       (2) Execute <unzip_root>\db\calendarinfusion_postgresql.sql
	e. Oracle
	   (1) I don't have an Oracle development system, so you're on your own,
	       but you can likely use the PostgreSQL scripts.
 
 5. Create the calendarInfusion DSN within the ColdFusion Administrator
    a. Login to the ColdFusion Administrator
    b. Click on the 'Data Sources' link
    d. Create the DSN using the appropriate driver, login, and password       

 6. Update the /config/mach-ii.xml file with the values specific to your
    environment. (See the Mach-II configuration instructions for more
	details.)  If you installed the application using the mapping 'calendar'
	and the website will be accessible via http://<your_domain>/calendar,
	then the only thing you should need to change is the dbDsn and dbType
	properties, which should reflect your DSN settings.
	(e.g. 'calendar' and 'msaccess', respectively.)

 7. Update the /public/index.cfm file to point to your /config/mach-ii.xml
    configuration file.

 8. You're ready to go.
 
 Additional details...
 
 -- To access the administrative sections of the applications, you will need
    to login using the administrator account. The default username and
    password are 'administrator' and 'password', respectively.  It is highly
    recommended that you change the password after your first login.  Within
    calendarInfusion, you can change the password by logging into the
    application, accessing the default calendar, and clicking on the
    'Profile' link in the navigation menu.
	
 -- If you want to extended calendarInfusion, there are some code generation
    utilities contained in the /public/_utilities/ directory.  It is
	recommended that you remove these on a production server.
